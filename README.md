# Rugby-Style Game

This is a simple game designed for an STM32 microcontroller platform. The objective is to reach a score of 3, similar to a rugby-style game.

## How to Play
- The game is played by interacting with buttons or inputs.
- Your goal is to reach a score of 3 before the opponent tackles you.

## Features

- **Display**: The game utilizes a graphical display to show the score and game progress.
- **Sound**: Includes sound effects using musical notes (defined in `musical_notes.h`).

## Requirements
- STM32 microcontroller
- buttons
- breadboard
- 12x12 lcd

## How to Compile and Run
1. Use the STM32 development environment (e.g., STM32CubeIDE) to compile the project.
2. Flash the compiled program to your STM32 board.
3. The game will start automatically on the device.
